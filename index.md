Hi, I'm a computer science major at California State University of Fullerton and I plan to graduate in 2027. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, Part 2: 

    Part two of lab three was a favorite of mine because I think it was my first time working with creating the functions. I didnâ€™t even know that the equation for finding the julian days was a thing so it was interesting learning about it. I enjoyed incorporating all the functions to return the output to the user. 

* Lab 4, Part 2: 

    I really enjoyed part two of lab 4 because it felt like a fun experience coding a game that the user could actually play with. I had a lot of fun and it helped me thoroughly understand taking input from the user. Also it was good to start learning how to compare data to each other. 

* Lab 9, Part 1: 

    Part two of lab 9 was also a favorite of mine because I started to learn using math in my code. I learned to find the average of a set of numbers and return the correct value. This stunned me during the coding process but I felt like I learned a lot from doing it.
